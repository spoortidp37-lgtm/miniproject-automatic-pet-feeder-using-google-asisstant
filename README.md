The pet feeder consists of hardware components such as a food dispenser, weight sensors, a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller (such as ESP8266 or ESP32), and a motorized mechanism to release food. The device connects to a cloud platform, enabling real-time control and scheduling. With the integration of Google Assistant, pet owners can issue voice commands to feed their pets, check the food level, or adjust feeding schedules. Additionally, notifications about the pet's feeding status can be sent to the owner's smartphone, ensuring they are informed about their pet's well-being.
The system is designed with user-friendly features, including manual override options, portion control, and a mobile app interface for customized feeding routines. The integration with IoT and voice control adds convenience, especially for busy pet owners, while ensuring that pets receive timely and accurate portions of food. The proposed system enhances pet care by providing a reliable, automated solution that leverages the latest in IoT and AI technologies.
